# My Ironhack pre-work project - The Javascript Module

<h2>This is the repository of my pre-work for the Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp - Coding a rover.</h2>

<h3><b>----Mars Rover Kata----</b></h3>

<p>THe pre-work was a pre-requisite to enter the Ironhack bootcamp.</p>

<p><b>-----Instructions-----</b></p>
<p>The final pre-work for the bootcamp consisted completed the following steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an object called <code>rover</code></li>
<li>It should have the following properties: <code>direction</code> <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li>Create the functions <code>turnLeft()</code>  <code>turnRight()</code>  <code>moveForward()</code>  <code>moveBackwards()</code> </li>
<li>Create a function that receives a list of commands</li>
<li>Add a property called <code>travelLog()</code> which will track the movements of the rover</li>
<li>b>BONUS:</b> Make sure your rover stays inside the limits of your 10x10 grid</li>
<li><b>BONUS:</b> Bring your rover to life</li>
</ul>


<h3><b>---Major challenges---</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Took me a while to figure out the swicth function and how to get passed not being able to visualize the rover</li>
  <li>The pre-work didn't include DOM manipulation so I had to do it by myself and with Google's help - Wasn't easy but it was an amazing challenge</li>
  <li>The Object oriented train of thought was hard to get into</li>
  <li>The amount of code and how to organize myself</li>
  <li>Not knowing yet very well how to manage Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, and debug.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>---Improvements for the future---</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Correct the bug of not having the animation from 0,0 to 0,1, etc</li>
  <li>Would like to create a class called rover so that the creation of more rovers was possible</li>
  <li>Apparition of random objects</li>
  <li>Gamification of some sort</li>
  <li>Improve the quality of the code</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>---Technologies used---</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>---Unsolved problems---</b></h3>
